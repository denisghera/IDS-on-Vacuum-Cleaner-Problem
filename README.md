# Project for Artificial Intelligence course at University

### It is using iterative deepening search to find the best path of a vacuum cleaner to cover 3 cells with random state (dirty/clean)
### A simulation of the actions performed will be rendered using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) with the possibility to rewind or regenerate the environment with new cell values.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting position of the vacuum is configurable in var.py
